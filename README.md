# AI Voice Assistant (Student)

This project implements an AI-powered voice assistant designed to enhance student productivity through hands-free task management.  It leverages cutting-edge technologies like PyTorch, NLTK, speech recognition, and OpenAI's GPT-3 API to provide a robust and feature-rich experience.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project was to create a voice assistant capable of improving student productivity.  Through the implementation of key features, the aim was to streamline task management and minimize distractions, ultimately leading to a 20% increase in productivity.

## Technologies Used

* **PyTorch:** Used for building and training the underlying AI models.
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Employed for natural language processing tasks, enabling the assistant to understand and interpret user commands.
* **Speech Recognition:** Integrated to allow for hands-free interaction with the assistant.
* **OpenAI GPT-3 API:** Leveraged to provide advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities, powering the conversational aspects of the assistant.

## Key Features

This voice assistant offers three core features designed to optimize student workflow:

* **Focus Mode:**  This feature allows users to block out distractions by temporarily disabling notifications and other potentially disruptive applications.  It helps users maintain concentration and focus on their current tasks.

* **Focus Graph:**  Provides a visual representation of the user's productivity over time.  This feature tracks task completion and time spent on various activities, offering insights into areas for improvement and promoting better time management.

* **Personalized Memory Functions:**  Enhances user interaction and time management by storing and retrieving personalized information.  This allows the assistant to remember important dates, deadlines, and other relevant details, providing timely reminders and facilitating efficient task organization.
